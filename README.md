# My Homebrew Tap

This is a home for my [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulas which are non-compliant with `homebrew/core` [acceptance criteria](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Acceptable-Formulae.md).

## Usage

Just draft from the tap:

    brew install rstuven/tap/<formula>

The tap will be added automatically to your Brew.

If you no longer want to track this repository, use

    brew untap rstuven/tap
